# Pepmon's PvP Resource Pack (64×) — Minecraft 1.21.4+

A clean, high-visibility 64× resource pack optimized for PvP in Minecraft 1.21.4 and newer.

## Highlights
- 64× textures tuned for clarity and responsiveness in combat
- Minimal visual clutter for better target acquisition
- Ready to use in vanilla or modded clients

## Requirements
- Minecraft 1.21.4 or newer
- The pack is distributed as a ZIP file that must contain `pack.mcmeta` at the archive root

## Quick installation (recommended)
1. Download the ZIP from the repository (Code → Download ZIP).  
2. Verify the ZIP contains `pack.mcmeta` at the top level. If you extracted and see a folder named like the pack, re-compress it so the archive root contains `pack.mcmeta`.  
    - Windows: Right-click the pack folder → Send to → Compressed (zipped) folder.  
    - macOS: Right-click the pack folder → Compress.  
3. Launch Minecraft.  
4. Options → Resource Packs → Open Pack Folder.  
5. Move the re-zipped `.zip` into the opened folder.  
6. Back in Minecraft, select the pack in the Available list and move it to Selected. Click Done.

Note: The pack will not appear if `pack.mcmeta` is nested inside another folder in the `.zip`.

## Optional: recommended in-game settings for PvP
- Graphics: Fast  
- Smooth Lighting: Off  
- Mipmap Levels: 0  
- GUI Scale: Personal preference (smaller for more screen space)  
- Particle settings: Decreased or Minimal

## Troubleshooting
- Pack doesn’t show: Ensure the ZIP contains `pack.mcmeta` at the archive root (not inside an extra folder).  
- Corrupted textures / weird colors: Try removing conflicting packs or resource pack ordering; clear Minecraft cache if necessary.  
- Still not working: Confirm Minecraft version ≥ 1.21.4 and test with only this pack enabled.
